# Lane Line Detection and Vehicle detection

Yet another lane line and vehicle detection with python and OpenCV for Udacity SDCND.

## Goals

* Compute the calibration matrix and distortion coefficients for calibration data.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Create a threshold binary image.
* Apply a "birds-eye view" perspective transform.
* Detect lane pixels.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Render lanes back onto the original image.
* Detect vehicle with CNN (Faster R-CNN).
* Render bounding boxes back to the image.
* Visual output for an user.
